//! Timer facilities for Tokio
//!
//! The default timer implementation is a hashed timing wheel. This structure
//! provides the best runtime characteristics for the majority of network
//! application patterns **as long as it is correctly configured**. A hashed
//! timing wheel's worst case is `O(n)` where `n` is the number of pending
//! timeouts.
//!
//! Most useful functions are on [`Timer`](struct.Timer.html).
//!
//! ## Example
//!
//! Here is a simple example of how to use the timer.
//!
//! ```rust
//! extern crate tokio_timer;
//! extern crate futures;
//!
//! use tokio_timer::*;
//! use futures::*;
//! use std::time::*;
//!
//! pub fn main() {
//!     // Create a new timer with default settings. While this is the easiest way
//!     // to get a timer, usually you will want to tune the config settings for
//!     // your usage patterns.
//!     let timer = Timer::default();
//!
//!     // Set a timeout that expires in 500 milliseconds
//!     let sleep = timer.sleep(Duration::from_millis(500));
//!
//!     // Use the `Future::wait` to block the current thread until `Sleep`
//!     // future completes.
//!     //
//!     sleep.wait();
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! ## Hashed Timing Wheel
//!
//! The hashed timing wheel timer is a coarse grained timer that is optimized
//! for cases where the timeout range is relatively uniform and high precision
//! is not needed. These requirements are very common with network related
//! applications as most timeouts tend to be a constant range (for example, 30
//! seconds) and timeouts are used more as a safe guard than for high
//! precision.
//!
//! The timer is inspired by the [paper by Varghese and
//! Lauck](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~nahum/w6998/papers/ton97-timing-wheels.pdf).
//!
//! A hashed wheel timer is implemented as a vector of "slots" that represent
//! time slices. The default slot size is 100ms. As time progresses, the timer
//! walks over each slot and looks in the slot to find all timers that are due
//! to expire. When the timer reaches the end of the vector, it starts back at
//! the beginning.
//!
//! Given the fact that the timer operates in ticks, a timeout can only be as
//! precise as the tick duration. If the tick size is 100ms, any timeout
//! request that falls within that 100ms slot will be triggered at the same
//! time.
//!
//! A timer is assigned to a slot by taking the expiration instant and
//! assigning it to a slot, factoring in wrapping. When there are more than one
//! timeouts assigned to a given slot, they are stored in a linked list.
//!
//! This structure allows constant time timer operations **as long as timeouts
//! don't collide**. In other words, if two timeouts are set to expire at
//! exactly `num-slots * tick-duration` time apart, they will be assigned to
//! the same bucket.
//!
//! The best way to avoid collisions is to ensure that no timeout is set that
//! is for greater than `num-slots * tick-duration` into the future.
//!
//! A timer can be configured with `Builder`.
//!
//! ## Runtime details
//!
//! When creating a timer, a thread is spawned. The timing details are managed
//! on this thread. When `Timer::set_timeout` is called, a request is sent to
//! the thread over a bounded channel.
//!
//! All storage needed to run the timer is pre-allocated, which means that the
//! timer system is able to run without any runtime allocations. The one
//! exception would be if the timer's `max_capacity` is larger than the
//! `initial_capacity`, in which case timeout storage is allocated in chunks as
//! needed. Timeout storage can grow but never shrink.
